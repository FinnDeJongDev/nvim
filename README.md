# Hey this is my Neovim config :D

### Requirements
It might not be all of them :\ I may have forgotten some requirements

- Lua
- LuaRocks
- FzF
- Fdfind (ubuntu's fd)
- Neovim    

For the background set your desktop wallpaper to [this](content.jpeg) or any other background you want.  
Then set your terminal settings to be transparent, this is done at profiles and go to colors, thange to built-in-themes and click GNOME-dark.  
Afterwards you click on the default color background. Make this black. And  click use transparent background. This should be around 12.5% or 1/8 to full.
